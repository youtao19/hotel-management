# Shift Handover Requirements Summary

## Fields to be Saved and Their Nullability

The following fields related to the shift handover functionality should be savable to the database and are explicitly allowed to be empty (nullable):

1.  **交班人 (Handover Person):** This field, representing the person handing over the shift, should be savable and optional.
2.  **接班人 (Receiving Person):** This field, representing the person receiving the shift, should be savable and optional.
3.  **备注 (Remarks):** This field, specifically for "special statistics" or general notes related to the shift handover, should be savable and optional.

## Database Schema Status

Based on `backend/database/postgreDB/tables/shift_handover.js`, the `handover_person`, `receive_person`, and `remarks` columns in the `shift_handover` table are already defined without `NOT NULL` constraints, meaning they are inherently nullable in the database schema. Therefore, no database migration is required to alter column nullability.

## Next Steps (Implementation Focus)

The implementation will focus on ensuring that:

*   **Backend Logic:** The API endpoints and modules responsible for saving shift handover data correctly accept and process these three fields, allowing them to be empty, and persist them to the database. Any server-side validation enforcing these fields as mandatory will be removed.
*   **Frontend Logic:** The user interface (UI) components for shift handover will allow these fields to be left blank. Any client-side validation (e.g., `required` attributes) making them mandatory will be removed, and the data will be correctly sent to the backend.
